Claiming your earnings is more of an accounting necessity than something that's useful or valuable to a user as far as LPT is concerned. When an orchestrator calls `reward()` the newly generated token sit in a pool that's credited towards their total stake. Each delegator is entitled to some of this token. How much they're owed needs to be calculated on a round-by-round basis and credited to their account. Hence, when they claim earnings they are paying for this calculation to take place on the blockchain, and the token to move from sitting in a big pool, to being allocated towards them individually.

Fees that an orchestrators earns in ETH, are immediately distributed into a delegator's account when they claim earnings however.

While delegators do need to do this calculation for every single round (day), claiming earnings once can do the calculation for 100 rounds.

* Delegators or orchestrators claim earnings whenever they want to change their delegation status: unstake, stake towards another orhcestrator, stake more.
* Claiming earnings once can update their status for up to 100 rounds. So if it's been longer than 100 rounds since the last update, you may have to claim earnings multiple times.
* If it's been less than 100 rounds, this happens in the background when you stake or unstake, you don't need to proactively claim earnings.
* If you are not changing your stake, the most effective strategy is to just claim earnings once every 100 rounds. Or you can just wait and not do anything, and then call it, say 3 times if it's been 300 rounds.
* **CAUTION**: After you claim earnings for a round, you can not call it again for that round. That means that if the orchestrator earns more fees or calls `reward()` later in that round, you can not access those rewards or fees. To really optimize, change your staking status late in the round after most of the fees have been collected and `reward()` has been called.
