        It's your job as a tokenholder to research orchestrators based upon
        their past performance, statistics, rates they are charging, and any
        social campaigns that theyâ€™ve posted indicating why they believe they
        will do a good job for the network. Click on any orchestrator to view
        their on chain statistics.
