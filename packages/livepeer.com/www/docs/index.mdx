## Livepeer API Documentation

Livepeer supports live streaming, video on demand, and transcoding across video
formats and protocols. The Livepeer API provides a secure, straightforward way
to transcode video using Livepeer infrastructure. Please note that the Livepeer
API product is under heavy development with new features added regularly.

# API Endpoints

`https://livepeer.com/api/stream`

- `POST /stream` - create a stream (Protected by `Bearer` API key auth)
- `GET /stream/:id` - getting streams by ID (Protected by `Bearer` API key
  auth)

`https://livepeer.com/api/broadcaster`

- `GET /api/broadcaster` a list of broadcasters

`{broadcaster_url}/live/{stream_id}/{media_number}.ts`

- `POST https://{broadcaster_url}/live/{stream_id}/{media_number}.ts` MPEG-TS
  segment ingest point after getting the broadcaster URL (using `POST`)
- This endpoint also works for `.mp4` files.  We recommend sending `.mp4` files that are **less than 120 seconds**.

# API Tutorial

In this tutorial you will transcode one source `.ts` segment into three renditions 
for playback. By the end of this tutorial, you will have an understanding of the
basic Livepeer API calls and expected responses. And from there, you can start
integrating your own platform with Livepeer's live transcoding service. Let's
begin!

_Note: this tutorial is most fitting for developers working on media servers or 
video services that involves transcoding.  If you are building a video application,
please refer to the Live Streaming API_

**Step 1:** Create a "stream" with the transcoding profiles you want by sending
POST to `/stream` with `name` and `profiles`. For example:

```shell
curl -X POST \
-H 'content-type: application/json' \
-H 'authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>' \
-d '{
  "name": "test_stream",
  "profiles": [
    {
      "name": "1080p",
      "bitrate": 6000000,
      "fps": 30,
      "width": 1920,
      "height": 1080
    },
    {
      "name": "720p",
      "bitrate": 2000000,
      "fps": 30,
      "width": 1280,
      "height": 720
    },
    {
      "name": "360p",
      "bitrate": 500000,
      "fps": 30,
      "width": 640,
      "height": 360
    }
  ]
}' \
https://livepeer.com/api/stream
```

You will get back a `json` response that includes an `id` field. This represents the ID of the stream. You will need this later.

**Step 2:** Request a list of Livepeer broadcasters address from `/broadcaster.`
For example:

```shell
curl https://livepeer.com/api/broadcaster \
  -H "authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>"
```

You will get back a list of `json` objects that represent a list of broadcaster addresses. Pick any of the broadcaster addresses to send the source `.ts` segment.

**Step 3:** Now it's time to POST your .ts segment. to
`{broadcaster_address}/live/{stream_id}/{media_number}.ts`, and get your results.

_In this example, we will use [`munpack`](https://linux.die.net/man/1/munpack) to unpack the multipart 
API response.  To install `munpack`, use `brew install mpack` for macos, 
and `apt install mpack` for Linux._

Set `Accept: multipart/mixed` headers. A continuous livestream should start with
the `media_number` set to `1`.ts and count upward to `2`.ts, `3`.ts and so on
for each segment.

Here is an example using the broadcaster address `https://test-broadcast-url.live`.
You'll need to replace that URL a broadcaster address from Step 2.

```shell
curl -i -X POST https://test-broadcast-url.live/live/<stream_id>/1.ts \
  -H "Accept: multipart/mixed" \
  --data-binary "@source_segment.ts" | munpack
```

You should see `1080p_1.ts`, `720p_1.ts`, and `360p_1.ts` in your directory. You should be able to play the separate `.ts` files using any video player.  For example, `ffplay 1080p_1.ts`

_Note: If there is a problem uploading a segment, you can try to make a new 
request for a list of broadcasters and POST to a different broadcaster address. 
You can still expect the stream to be at the same URL._

_if you don't see `1080p_1.ts`, `720p_1.ts`, and `360p_1.ts` most likely there 
was an issue with the request you sent.  Please visit our [support channel on Discord](https://discord.gg/98g8Dqn), 
or email support@livepeer.org._

_You can save the response directly to a file if you don't pipe in into `munpack`. 
The content of the API response looks something like:_
```

# Live Streaming API

You can send an RTMP video stream to the Livepeer API and get the transcoded 
HLS video stream. You can serve the transcoded outputs through a CDN or save them 
for future use.

Livepeer is currently testing this feature with select beta users. If you would
like to use this today, email [sales@livepeer.com](mailto:sales@livepeer.com?subject=[Beta%20request]%20RTMP%20API).
