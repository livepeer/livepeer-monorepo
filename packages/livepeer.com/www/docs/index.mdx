## Introduction to the Livepeer API

Livepeer supports live streaming, video on demand, and transcoding across video
formats and protocols. The Livepeer API provides a secure, straightforward way
to transcode video using Livepeer infrastructure. Please note that the Livepeer
API product is under heavy development with new features added regularly.

# API

**URL**

`https://livepeer.com/api`

**Endpoints**

`/stream`

- `POST /stream` - create a stream (Protected by `Bearer` API key auth)
- `GET /stream/:id` - getting streams by ID (Protected by `Bearer` API key
  auth)

`/broadcaster`

- `GET /api/broadcaster` a list of broadcasters

`{broadcaster_url}/live/{stream_id}/{media_number}.ts`

- `POST https://{broadcaster_url}/live/{stream_id}/{media_number}.ts` MPEG-TS
  segment ingest point after getting the broadcaster URL (using `POST`)

# Integration via HTTP Push API

Using the API is simple. First you create a stream, then you use the provided
list of broadcasters to stream segments for transcoding.

**Requirements**

Incoming live streams must be segmented into .ts video segments in H.264. We
recommend segmenting the video into the smallest size possible to minimize
latency. Each segment should ideally contain a single keyframe interval.

### Quick Tutorial

In this tutorial you will transcode one .ts segment into three renditions for
playback. By the end of this tutorial, you will have an understanding of the
basic Livepeer API calls and expected responses. And from there, you can start
integrating your own platform with Livepeer's live transcoding service. Let's
begin!

**Step 1:** Create a "stream" with the transcoding profiles you want by sending
POST to `/stream` with `name` and `profiles`. For example:

```shell
curl -X POST \
-H 'content-type: application/json' \
-H 'authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>' \
-d '{
  "name": "eli",
  "profiles": [
    {
      "name": "1080p",
      "bitrate": 6000000,
      "fps": 30,
      "width": 1920,
      "height": 1080
    },
    {
      "name": "720p",
      "bitrate": 2000000,
      "fps": 30,
      "width": 1280,
      "height": 720
    },
    {
      "name": "360p",
      "bitrate": 500000,
      "fps": 30,
      "width": 640,
      "height": 360
    }
  ]
}' \
https://livepeer.com/api/stream
```

You will get back a `stream_id`. You will need this later.

**Step 2:** Request a list of Livepeer broadcasters address from `/broadcaster.`
For example:

```shell
curl https://livepeer.com/api/broadcaster \
  -H "authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>"
```

Pick any of the broadcaster addresses at random to send the source video.

**Step 3:** Now it's time to POST your .ts segment. to
`{broadcaster_url}/live/{stream_id}/{media_number}.ts`

Set `Accept: multipart/mixed` headers. A continuous livestream should start with
the `media_number` set to `1`.ts and count upward to `2`.ts, `3`.ts and so on
for each segment.

Here is an example using the broadcaster URL `https://test-broadcast-url.live`.
You'll need to replace that URL a broadcaster address from Step 2.

```shell
curl -X POST https://<https://test-broadcast-url.live>/live/<stream_id>/1.ts \
  -H "Accept: multipart/mixed" \
  --data-binary "@my_test_segment.ts" > out.ts
```

Note: If there is ever a problem uploading a segment, make a new request for a
list of broadcasters and push to a different one. But still expect the stream to
be at the same URL.

**Step 4:** The out.ts file contains 3 different segments. Use `ffplay` to play
it back. You will see the same segment 3 times, each with a lower resolution.

When you integrate your own video platform with Livepeer, your platform should
split the response into 3 different video segments based on the text delimiter,
and insert them into a HLS playlist for playback. The content of the file looks
something like:

```
--27bee784e2f2672487f5
Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="1080p_101.ts"
Content-Length: 459284
Content-Type: video/MP2T
Rendition-Name: 1080p
...Data
--27bee784e2f2672487f5
Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="720p_101.ts"
Content-Length: 459284
Content-Type: video/MP2T
Rendition-Name: 720p
...Data
--27bee784e2f2672487f5
Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="360p_101.ts"
Content-Length: 459284
Content-Type: video/MP2T
Rendition-Name: 360p
```

# Coming soon: Integration via RTMP API

This option is very similar to the Integration via HTTP Push API above, but it
removes the requirement to have segmented your stream into .ts video segments
before sending it to a Livepeer broadcaster.

Soon, you will be able to send an RTMP stream to the Livepeer ingest point and
consume the transcoded HLS stream from the same broadcaster. You can serve the
transcoded outputs through a CDN or save them for future use.

Livepeer is currently testing this feature with select beta users. If you would
like to use this today, email [sales@livepeer.com](mailto:sales@livepeer.com?subject=[Beta%20request]%20RTMP%20API).
