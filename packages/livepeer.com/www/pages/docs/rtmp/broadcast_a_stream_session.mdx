### How to broadcast a stream session

Your users or your application will need to be able to push an RTMP stream. When configuring the software to push streams, use the secret **stream key** and **RTMP ingest URL** from the **stream page**.

Depending on the software used to push your RTMP stream, youâ€™ll be prompted for the following:
- Stream Key: In some cases, this is called a *Stream Name*. Input your Livepeer **stream key**, not your Livepeer stream name.
- Server URL: Input the regionally optimized Livepeer **RTMP ingest URL**. For streams originating in North America, use rtmp://na-ingest-url/. For streams originating in the EU, use rtmp://eu-ingest-url/. 
- Location or URL: Input the ingest url with the **stream key** appended. For streams originating in North America, use rtmp://na-ingest-url/stream-key. For streams originating in the EU, use rtmp://eu-ingest-url/stream-key.
