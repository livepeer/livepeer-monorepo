### Understanding the stream page specifications

Navigate to a stream page by clicking on a stream name on the **stream list page**, [https://livepeer.com/app/user](/app/user).

The stream name is at the top of the stream page.

These are the other fields on the stream page.

| Field   |  Notes      
|----------| - | 
| **Stream key** |    Your stream key is a secret. Protect this key. The stream key is used to authenticate while ingesting RTMP streams.  |
| **RTMP ingest URL**   |    Your RTMP ingest URL is based on the region your stream originates in. The regional ingest URLs are the following: <ul><li>North America: rtmp://mdw-rtmp.livepeer.com/live/<strong>stream-key</strong></li><li>EU: rtmp://fra-rtmp.livepeer.com/live/<strong>stream-key</strong></li></ul> |
| **Playback URL**   | The playback URL is based on the region your stream originates in. https://<strong>region</strong>-cdn.livepeer.com/hls/<strong>playbackId</strong>/index.m3u8. The playback URL is listed on the <strong>stream page</strong>.|
| **Renditions**   | The width (pixels), height (pixels) and frame rate (frames per second) for each rendition are listed. |
