### How to create a stream

Before live streaming via the Livepeer API, you will need to create a Livepeer account and be able to create a RTMP stream. You do not need to create an API key.

1. Open your Livepeer account and navigate to the **streams list page**, https://livepeer.com/app/user.
1. Click the button to create a new stream.
1. On the **create a new stream page**, input a **stream name**.
    * Your stream name needs to be unique and include URL compatible characters only.
1. When you are ready, **save** your stream and go on to the next step. 
    * After saving your stream, you will be redirected to the **stream page**.
