### How to transcode .ts segments

Before transcoding your stream of .ts segments, be sure to [create a stream with defined rendition profiles](/docs/segment-based-ingest/create-a-stream-and-define-renditions) and [gather a list of broadcasters](/docs/segment-based-ingest/get-a-list-of-broadcasters). It may also be helpful to review how to [authenticate](/docs/segment-based-ingest/authentication).

`POST` your .ts segment. to `{broadcaster_address}/live/{stream_id}/{media_number}.ts`

In the header be sure to `Accept: multipart/mixed`.

A continuous livestream should start with the media_number set to 1.ts and count upward to 2.ts, 3.ts and so on for each segment.

If you encounter a problem uploading a segment, try making a new request for a list of broadcasters and `POST` to a different broadcaster address. You can still expect the stream to be at the same URL.

Mixed within the data about your transcoded video, the content of the API response will include something like:
