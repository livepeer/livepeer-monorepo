### How to get a list of broadcasters

The second step to live transcoding .ts segments is getting a list of broadcasters.

`GET` a list of broadcasters via `https://livepeer.com/api/broadcaster`.

Here is an example response:

```
[
  {
    "address":"https://example-broadcaster-url-1.livepeer.live"
  },
  {
    "address":"https://example-broadcaster-url-2.livepeer.live"
  },
  {
    "address":"https://example-broadcaster-url-3.livepeer.live"
  }
]
```
