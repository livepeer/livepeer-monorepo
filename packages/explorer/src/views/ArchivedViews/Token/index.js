                  totaling a release of 6.3M LPT. These tokens are available for
                  anyone to claim on a first-come first-serve basis. You can

        <h2>Key Points to Claim LPT using the Livepeer Miner</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Anyone can claim LPT for unclaimed eligible Ethereum accounts. You
            do not need to provide the eligible ethereum addresses. Livepeer
            provides and submits the eligible Ethereum addresses for you.
          </li>
          <li>
            Each round of Livepeer Mining can claim LPT for 20 unclaimed
            accounts. You can claim as many of the eligible unclaimed accounts
            as you want by mining LPT tokens multiple times or writing a script
            that claims more accounts.
          </li>
          <li>
            When you mine an unclaimed account, the 2.4 LPT is split between you
            and the account holder. The portion of LPT the miner receives grows
            proportionally with every block that passes between the start block
            of 6,034,099 on July 26th. However, given the scarcity of LPT, they
            will be available on a first come first serve basis.

          How does Livepeer work?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Livepeer is an open source project that is focused on decentralizing
          live video streaming over the internet. Content creators send video
          into the Livepeer network, and the network takes care of transcoding
          it into all the different formats necessary to reach the majority of
          the devices on the planet, and distributing it to as many users as
          want to consume it. &nbsp;

          How can Livepeer Token be used?
        </h3>
        <p>
          The main use of LPT is to bond it towards a transcoder. Token holders
          can either do transcoding work themselves, or bond their LPT towards a
          Transcoder node who does the work on their behalf. Bonding LPT means
          depositing some token into a smart contract, which is locked up for a
          period of time (currently one week) before it can be withdrawn. This
          serves as a security deposit which can be taken away if the user does
          not act honestly. Transcoders who do the work earn ETH fees from
          content creators who pay to use the network, as well as inflationary
          LPT. Transcoders share those fees and rewards with token holders who
          bond towards them. You can head to the Transcoders tab to see how much
          in fees and rewards each Transcoder is willing to share with its token
          holders. The work that users who bond have the right to do comes in
          two forms:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>running transcoding nodes</li>
          <li>bond to a transcoder.</li>

          Yes, Livepeer launched to mainnet on April 30th and is in alpha.

        </h3>
        <p>
          The initial distribution prioritizes open access and wide distribution
          to users who wish to participate. The genesis state will specify the
          rules for generation of 10,000,000 initial LPT. This initial token
          will be generated and released to the crowd, team, early supporters,
          and community in a gradual rollout over the next 36 months. Ownership
          in the network will be decentralized and proportional from the get go,
          with open access to the Livepeer token for the community being baked
          in from day one.
        </p>
        <p>
          Core team and pre-sale participants will be vesting over time, such
          that no centralized parties ever control a majority of the distributed
          token used for staking within the Livepeer network. The token pool
          will be distributed as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Founders and early team</b>: 12.35% — vesting over 36 months from
            network launch.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Pre-sale purchasers</b>: 19% — vesting over 18 months from
            network launch. Purchasers have facilitated 3 years of runway for
            Livepeer’s lean, engineering focused core team.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Crowd</b>: 63.437% — generated over 3–18 months using the
            MerkleMine algorithm.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Grant</b>: 0.213% — immediate issued to a couple early advisors
            and contributors who helped Livepeer get off the ground.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Long term project endowment</b>: 5% — to be used to ensure the
            longevity of the Livepeer project.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Anyone can claim LPT for unclaimed eligible Ethereum accounts during
          the Claim Period, from July 26th, 2018 until all accounts are claimed.
        </p>

          How much LPT do you get per submission?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Each time you click get token you generate a transaction that contains
          20 proofs for 20 eligible Ethereum accounts. The LPT is split between
          you, the caller, and the original account owner whom you mine token
          for, in proportion to how far into the claim period we are. Early on
          the portion you, the caller, gets is very small, but it grows over
          time. As an example, 500,000 blocks into the claim period, the caller
          would get 500,000 / 2,500,000 * 2.44 LPT, or 1 5th of the 2.44 LPT ==
          0.49 LPT for one single proof. The original account owner would get
          the rest. The portion of LPT the caller receives grows proportionally
          with every block that passes between the start block of 6,034,099 on
          July 26th. However, given the scarcity of LPT, they will be available
          on a first come first serve basis.

          Livepeer is not selling any LPT, as there is no crowd sale, ICO or
          investment opportunity. No one from Livepeer will ask you for money.
          However, in order to submit a transaction to generate LPT, you have to
          pay the gas cost required to get transactions confirmed on the
          blockchain, and this price varies quite a bit from hour to hour on the
          network in response to market conditions. To learn more about
