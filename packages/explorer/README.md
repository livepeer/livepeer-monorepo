## Installation

**Run `yarn` from the root of the monorepo.**

Once you've done that, you're all set! ‚ú®

> **Warning**: If you modify any dependencies of this project (`@livepeer/apollo`, `@livepeer/graphql-sdk`, etc), you will need to rebuild those projects for those updates propagate to this one.

## Developing

If you want to hack on this app, just run:

```bash
yarn start
```

Be sure to watch the output and follow the instructions on the command line.

Once the app is available (most likely at `http://localhost:3000`), you are free to edit files in the [`src`](https://github.com/livepeer/livepeerjs/tree/master/packages/explorer/src) directory. The app will rebuild and update as you make changes.

This project is bootstrapped with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), so all of their documentation applies here as well.

> **Info**: This app was originally created with both `redux` and `apollo`. As development has progressed, `redux` has served very little purpose, and is in the process of being phased out of this app.

## Building

You can build this app as a website or as a desktop app (via `electron`).

- **Website:** `yarn build:web` (outputs to `./build`)
- **Desktop:** `yarn build:desktop` (outputs to `./dist`)

**Note:** Only the OSX desktop build has been configured. If you would like to add a configuration for linux or windows, please modify the config accordingly in [package.json](https://github.com/livepeer/livepeerjs/blob/master/packages/explorer/package.json#L45), and [file a PR](https://github.com/livepeer/livepeerjs/pulls) üçª

### Customizing A Build

In either case, here are some environment variables you can use to customize the build:

| Variable                       | Default       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------------------ | ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `NODE_ENV`                     | `development` | `yarn start` always sets this to `development` and `yarn build` will always set this to `production`. **You should not have to modify this variable**                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `PUBLIC_URL`                   | `/`           | The root url of the site (only applies to production builds)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `REACT_APP_HTTP_PROVIDER`      |               | By default, the app will use the Livepeer testnet provider (`https://ethrpc-testnet.livepeer.org`), but this option allows you to specify a custom Ethereum http provider. You may want to use one of the following: <br />**[infura.io](https://infura.io)** - `https://<network>.infura.io/<your-token>`<br />**local geth/testrpc** - `http://localhost:8545`<br /> |
| `REACT_APP_CONTROLLER_ADDRESS` |               | Set a custom controller address (Livepeer smart contract entry point)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `REACT_APP_GA_TRACKING_ID`     |               | The Google Analytics tracking id to use (production environment only)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
