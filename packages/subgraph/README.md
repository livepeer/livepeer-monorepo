This package contains the source code for the Livepeer Subgraph, a project for
indexing and querying Livepeer data from the Ethereum blockchain using [The Graph](https://thegraph.com).

## Quick Start

### Running a local Graph Node with Docker

The quickest way to run a Graph Node locally is to use the
[graph-node docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/graphprotocol/graph-node/).

1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com)
2. Clone https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node
3. Edit `docker/docker-compose.yml`
   - Replace `ethereum: "dev:http://parity:8545"` with `ethereum: "mainnet:https://mainnet.infura.io/"`
   - Remove `RUST_LOG: info`
   - Remove the Parity service (`parity:` and everything below it)
4. Run `cd docker && docker-compose up`

This will automatically provision a server with rust, postgres, and ipfs, and
spin up a graph node with a GraphiQL interface at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.
Congrats, you're now ready to build and deploy the Livepeer subgraph. You may
skip ahead to [Building & deploying the Subgraph](#building-and-deploying-the-livepeer-subgraph)

### Running a local Graph Node _without_ Docker

If you wish to run a graph node without docker you need to have the
following installed on your system:

- Rust (latest stable) - [How to install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/install.html)
- PostgreSQL v9.6 or above – [PostgreSQL Downloads](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
- IPFS – [Installing IPFS](https://ipfs.io/docs/install/)

For Ethereum network data you can either run a local node or use Infura.io:

- Local node – [Installing and running Ethereum node](https://ethereum.gitbooks.io/frontier-guide/content/getting_a_client.html)
- Infura infra – [Infura.io](https://infura.io/)

Note: We recommend using Infura.io. The Livepeer Subgraph requires access to contract state which means if you'd like to use a local Ethereum node you'd have to run it in archive mode which is not practical unless you have a lot of time to sync or already have one running.

Once you've installed everything follow these steps:

1. Run `ipfs init` followed by `ipfs daemon`
2. Run `initdb -D .postgres` followed by `createdb graph-node`
3. If using Ubuntu, you may need to install additional packages:
   - `sudo apt-get install -y clang libpq-dev libssl-dev pkg-config`
4. Clone https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node and run `cargo build`

Once you have all the dependencies set up you can run the following:

```
cargo run -p graph-node --release -- \
  --postgres-url postgresql://USERNAME[:PASSWORD]@localhost:5432/graph-node \
  --ethereum-rpc mainnet:https://mainnet.infura.io/ \
  --ipfs 127.0.0.1:5001 \
```

Try your OS username as `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD`. The password might be
optional, it depends on your setup.

This will also spin up a GraphiQL interface at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

### Building and Deploying the Livepeer Subgraph

Back in our subgraph directory, run

```
yarn codegen
yarn deploy
```

After downloading the latest blocks from Ethereum, you should begin to see
Livepeer smart contract events flying in. Open a GraphiQL browser at
localhost:8000 to query the Graph Node.

Here's an example query for fetching Livepeer transcoders:

```
query {
  transcoders {
    id
    rewardCut
    feeShare
    pricePerSegment
    pendingRewardCut
    pendingFeeShare
    pendingPricePerSegment
    totalStake
    lastRewardRound
    active
    status
    rewards {
      rewardTokens
      round {
        id
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Here's another example query for fetching rounds:

```
query {
  rounds {
    id
    rewards {
      rewardTokens
      transcoder {
        id
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Explorer Integration

Once you've got your Graph Node running and successfully deployed the Livepeer
Subgraph, you're ready to integrate it with the Explorer. Simply set the
environment variable `REACT_APP_LIVEPEER_SUBGRAPH` inside `.env.development` to
your graphql endpoint.

For example:
`REACT_APP_LIVEPEER_SUBGRAPH=http://localhost:8000/by-name/livepeer/graphql`

The explorer will begin quering indexed transcoder data from the Graph Node.
Note that if you shutdown the Graph Node, the Explorer will gracefully fallback
to querying the transcoder data from the blockchain directly.
